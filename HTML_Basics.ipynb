        "Following the basic structure of an HTML page is important because it helps the browser understand how to properly display the content. When the structure is correct, the webpage looks and works the same across different devices and browsers. It also makes the code easier to read and manage, especially when working in a team. A proper structure also helps search engines read the page better, which can improve its visibility online. Overall, using the correct structure is a good habit that makes web development more organized and efficient.\n"
